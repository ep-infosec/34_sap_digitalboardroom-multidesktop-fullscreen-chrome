Multi Desktop Full Screen for Chrome shows a web page extended across one or more desktops without a menu bar, toolbar or title bar. Without this app, Google Chrome can only use full screen on a single desktop monitor.

With this Chrome App we can use Windows 10 to extend the desktop (which is a standard way of doing things and does not require specific graphics cards) instead of using the graphics cards to make a combined desktop.

## Requirements ##
* Windows 10
* Google Chrome
* All touchscreens on monitors enabled and working independently.

## Setup Instructions ##
### Use Windows 10 to extend the desktop over three screens ###
*Do not use the graphics card to combine the three screens into a single desktop as that will confuse the Windows 10 Tablet PC Settings as it will think you only have one screen.*

2. **Change the size of text, apps and other items to 100%**

Under **Multiple displays** make sure you:

1. Extend the desktop to all three of your displays
2. *Note: If you need to you can rearrange the display order so that when you select identify then match the order shown  under Customize your displays (1 - 2  - 3, or 2 - 1 - 3, etc)*
3. Make your **left-most display** the **main display** (primary)

### Use Windows 10 Tablet PC Settings for touch ###
You can now set up touch, using Windows 10 Tablet PC Settings instead of using vendor specific software to combine three touchscreens into a single touchscreen.

1. Go to the Windows Start menu and search for and then select Tablet PC Settings
